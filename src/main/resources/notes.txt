In Command Pattern there are 3 components
1. Receiver
2. Command
3. Invoker

1.Receiver: This is the object on which the command will act. The command will executed on this   object.
The request that we encapsulate in command and called on receiver. Here receiver is AirConditioner class.
The commands are executed on AirCondition object. (Receiver object.)

2. Command: This is an interface . It declares methods for executing an action.
We can implement various commands by this command interface.
Every command object holds a reference of Receiver object.
Here in our all 3 command classes we have a reference of AC class

3. Invoker: It initiates request. It has a reference of command object and triggers execution of command.
Here invoker is Remote class. It has a reference of Command.
The pressButton() method of invoker initiated the command.

How to identify when to use this pattern:

1. When you see that requests that we are sending needs to be encapsulated as objects.
And you see that in request we need to send parameter.

2.Need for Undo and Redo operation.
You can maintain a history of commands by storing command objects in a stack.

3. When you need to log and audit all commands that were executed.
